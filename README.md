## About This Report

Data science involves the use of statistical and computational tools to extract meaningful information from often messy and convoluted sets of data. 
It can also be used to make additional predictions on new data based on models built from our given dataset. 
In this report, we are given data from experiments in the paper: *Distributed Coding of Choice, Action and Engagement Across the Mouse Brain* and are tasked with predicting trial feedback given the neural activity of a mouse. To do this, we must carry out a basic data science pipeline: exploratory analysis, data integration, and predictive modeling. We will then be given an unlabeled dataset for which we must correctly predict feedback. 

The research paper *Distributed Coding of Choice, Action and Engagement Across the Mouse Brain* looked at the neuronal activity in four different mice as they made decisions based on visual contrast. The data includes each brain area's spike activity over the trial period, the contrast of the stimuli, and the feedback which could be 1 or -1 corresponding to a right or wrong answer. The goal of this project is to correctly predict the feedback given data on neuronal activity, time, and contrast using various classification and prediction methods.
